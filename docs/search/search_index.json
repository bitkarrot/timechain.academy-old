Hello future Forkers, Branchers and Pull Requesters! This application contains challenges for learning Git and GitHub\u2014by using real Git and GitHub, not emulators. You'll be learning the awesome (and not so scary) command line and GitHub which means when you finish all of the challenges you'll have real repositories on your GitHub account and green squares on your contribution chart . What to Install You will need this app, Git-it as well as a text editor. You'll also of course need Git and the first challenge in Git-it helps you get that set up. But if you want to get a head start, go for it! You'll continue to use Git and your text editor throughout your bright social coding future. As a part of the challenges you'll also create a (free) account on GitHub. If you've already got one, high-five! Git We recommend installing GitHub Desktop (free) because it installs Git in the most consistent way across supported operating systems (Windows and Mac). We won't use the app itself in the challenges (but it is really useful once you get going in Git!), just the Git that it install for you. Note\u2014If you're using Windows, you should use the Git Shell app as your terminal\u2014it is installed with GitHub Desktop. In Mac and Linux you can use the app Terminal , which is already on your computer. Text Editor I'm quite partial (I'm on the team!) but Atom is a great text editor (also free) and it is built on Electron.js , just like Git-it. Visit the website and download the version for your operating system. Sublime , Microsoft VS Code and Adobe Brackets are other options. Git-it You can view the releases section of this repository to find the download for your operating system. Click to download your version. Once it has downloaded to your default Downloads directory, unzip the folder and run the Git-it executable. The executables for Mac, Windows and Linux: Mac Right (control) click the Git-it icon, select Open and then Open again. You can drag the icon into your Applications directory if you want, but it's not required. If needed, more detailed installation instructions can be found in this issue. Windows Double-click the executable. Linux Double-click the executable. If the app isn't running, see this issue . Get Started! Open Git-it and click the button to begin the first challenge. Have your terminal and text editor open, too. Follow along with the instructions in each challenge and use the terminal or editor as instructed. When you've completed the steps in a challenge click 'Verify'. Depending on the challenge you may need to also select the folder you did your work in for Git-it to verify. Questions? Open an issue on this repository. Want to contribute or build locally? See the contributing documentation Tips For Getting Started Code snippets often times look like $ some code-stuff --here .

This brief tutorial is aimed to help noobies setup Plebnet Playground and Bitcoin Core on MacOS in less that hald and hour. CHECK: You can install all of this in a virtual environment if you have one. For simplicity we will be doing this on our everyday admin user account. Nothing in this tutorial should break or interfere with the daily running of your machine. Prerequisites MacOS laptop or desktop running MacOS Mojave or above. We have not tested on earlier versions. I am using MacOS Catalina 10.15 but this process is compatible with later versions as well. ? are there any known compatability issues with newest M1 chips vs Intel?? The Xcode Command Line Tools are a collection of build tools for macOS. These tools must be installed in order to build Bitcoin Core from source. More about that here . To install, run the following command from your terminal: xcode-select --install You will need a Github account. If you haven't got one, set one up. We will use the git version control to fork and clone both Bitcoin Core and Plebnet Playground onto our local machine. NOTE: If you are not familiar with Git yet, don't worry, there is another lesson on this. For the moment just think of it as a version control protocol that allows you to copy a version of the source code onto your local machine to then compile and run it locally. Plebnet Playground runs on Docker which is an open-source platform used for developing, deploying, and managing applications in lightweight virtual environments called containers. The default Terminal that runs either bash or zsh and the Homebrew Package manager. Using the Command Line This tutorial asumes basic to no experience using the Command Line. If this freaks you out DO NOT WORRY , follow the steps and you will slowly become familiar with using basic commands, installing the necessary dependencies to run Plebnet Playground and getting under the hood running Bitcoin Core on your machine. If you are familiar with CLI already bare with us. If you haven't already, install Homebrew Package manager . Homebrew helps install packages to their own directory and then symlinks their files into /usr/local (on macOS Intel). Homebrew makes it super easy and safe to install and uninstall open source software dependencies compatible with Linux. /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\" If you haven't already, make sure you have git installed: brew install git Once installed you can use brew info git to confirm the version of git you are using: We are also going to need Python 3 installed. Python is a programming language. If you are already managing different python versions consider using Pyenv to manage these, alternatively: brew install python@3 check the Python version: python --version ...and you should see something like: Now we will install GNU Make is a tool which will allow us to build and compile our package source code locally. brew install make Finally let's install Docker. We could do this straight from the website, but we are now command line ninjas and just need a couple of brewskies: brew install docker-compose followed by: brew install --cask docker Now we're ready to rock and roll forking our code from Github. Forking repositories We are going to use Github to \"fork\" or copy the latest version of the Bitcoin Core and the Plebnet Playground Docker repositories. Enter your Github and follow the links to both accounts. Bitcoin Plebnet Playground Click on the fork button to fork the original repositories into your own Github account. It will ask you to name the new fork, but you can keep the default name. Here is what my Github looks like below. You should see both forks under your remote Repositories tab. Git cloning repositories We are now going to use the git clone command to yes, clone the version you just forked onto your Github, onto to your local machine. Github conveniantly gives you an easy way to copy the comand straight to your terminal. Enter your forked Github repostiory and find the green Code button. On the drop down you will see options to clone. Unless you already have SSH setup with your Github (Github class) Copy the one under HTTPS. In your Terminal first lets create a new directory in Documents and call it Github. You can do this in the Finder, alternatively type: cd ~/Documents mkdir Github cd ~/Documents/Github Now type: git clone and then paste or CMD + V the address you just copied. It should look like this only addressed to your own Github: git clone https://github.com/addyourgithubhere/bitcoin.git Now lets do the same for the same for the Plebnet Playground repo. NOTE: Make sure you are actually inside the directory you want to clone into. git clone https://github.com/addyourgithubhere/plebnet-playground-docker.git Now you should see in your Finder window the two cloned repositories something like this: Pretty cool huh. Git Checkout Now for the the Bitcoin clone we want to check out that the version we have downloaded can be verified with the latest released commit. We do this by going into the Bitcoin/bitcoin original repo, scroll down to the bottom right Releases > Latest This brings up Bitcoin Core 23.0 as of time of writing, and on the subheading we can see a hash on the right which begins with fcf6c8 Click on this and we can see the commit hash on the right: fcf6c8f4eb217763545ede1766831a6b93f583bd Lets copy this and go back to Terminal and type: git checkout fcf6c8f4eb217763545ede1766831a6b93f583bd This will report back to us: You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch. This confirms we are indeed using the latest commit. Building Plebnet Docker Now we are going to build and compile the code base of the Plebnet Playground Docker. See here for the Github README documentation. Enter the directory where the plebnet-playground-docker has been cloned. cd ~/Documents/Github/plebnet-playground-docker Now let's compile: make init NOTE: If our other dependencies have not been yet installed this will fail as it will require a version of python 3 and docker to work. This can be done via make build or make initialize . See other make commands using just typing make . Install and start all services ./install.sh Builiding Bitcoin Core Enter the directory where the bitcoin repository has been cloned. See MacOs Bitcoin Buildguide . I reccomend reading through this to usnderstand the various dependencies and options available. We will go with a bare bones simple compiliation. The first step is to download the required dependencies. These dependencies represent the packages required to get a bare bones installation up and running. brew install automake libtool boost pkg-config libevent NOTE: These are 5 different dependencies which we are installing in one brew command. Awesome! Also we will AVOID installing berkeley-db@4 dependency because we do not need support for legacy wallets. Bitcoin Core includes a GUI built with the cross-platform Qt Framework. To compile the GUI, we need to install qt@5. brew install qt@5 Configuration There are various ways to configure Bitcoin core, but we will be doing the bare minimal as we don't require legacy support. ./autogen.sh Now we add some configuration options to disable tests and other stuff. ./configure --disable-tests --disable-man --disable-bench --without-bdb Again db@4 is only required to support for legacy wallets, which we don't need thus --without-bdb Compiling Now lets compile Bitcoin Core: make Now: ./src/bitcoind -conf=/Users/$(whoami)/Documents/GitHub/plebnet-playground-docker/bitcoin-signet/bitcoin.conf !!! Would like to break down what this command does. We did not make and empty configuration file like in the instructions !! This will take a while to compile so be patient. Launching Plebnet From within the plebnet repo we can start to run the play commands: play play-bitcoin play-bitcoin gettxoutsetinfo play-bitcoin-iftop docker ps To start the docker we can use: This will prompt Docker Desktop to request priviledged access: Docker Desktop will start up: play-lnd play-lnd newaddress tb1q0yfkqcs384w3hlq8ksgzcgcxq9dmyydg9h9unr play-getcoins play-lnd walletbalance play-bitcoin netinfo 5 Ride The Lightning Baby RTL will at http://localhost:3000 the default password is password and it will ask you to change this on first login. open http://localhost:3000","title":"Playground"},{"location":"playground/#setting-up-plebnet-playground-on-macos","text":"","title":"Setting up Plebnet Playground on MacOS"},{"location":"playground/#resources","text":"Plebnet Playground Docker Readme Bitcoin Core Bitcoin MacOS Build Guide Plebnet Fun","title":"Resources:"},{"location":"playground/#aim","text":"Plebnet Playground is a sandbox environment to help Bitcoin plebs get under the hood with Lightning LND and mess around without using real sats.

Nothing in this tutorial should break or interfere with the daily running of your machine.","title":"Aim"},{"location":"playground/#prerequisites","text":"MacOS laptop or desktop running MacOS Mojave or above. We have not tested on earlier versions. I am using MacOS Catalina 10.15 but this process is compatible with later versions as well. ? are there any known compatability issues with newest M1 chips vs Intel?? The Xcode Command Line Tools are a collection of build tools for macOS. These tools must be installed in order to build Bitcoin Core from source. More about that here . To install, run the following command from your terminal: xcode-select --install You will need a Github account. If you haven't got one, set one up. We will use the git version control to fork and clone both Bitcoin Core and Plebnet Playground onto our local machine. NOTE: If you are not familiar with Git yet, don't worry, there is another lesson on this. For the moment just think of it as a version control protocol that allows you to copy a version of the source code onto your local machine to then compile and run it locally. Plebnet Playground runs on Docker which is an open-source platform used for developing, deploying, and managing applications in lightweight virtual environments called containers. The default Terminal that runs either bash or zsh and the Homebrew Package manager.","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"playground/#using-the-command-line","text":"This tutorial asumes basic to no experience using the Command Line. If this freaks you out DO NOT WORRY , follow the steps and you will slowly become familiar with using basic commands, installing the necessary dependencies to run Plebnet Playground and getting under the hood running Bitcoin Core on your machine. If you are familiar with CLI already bare with us. If you haven't already, install Homebrew Package manager . Homebrew helps install packages to their own directory and then symlinks their files into /usr/local (on macOS Intel). Homebrew makes it super easy and safe to install and uninstall open source software dependencies compatible with Linux. /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\" If you haven't already, make sure you have git installed: brew install git Once installed you can use brew info git to confirm the version of git you are using: We are also going to need Python 3 installed. Python is a programming language. If you are already managing different python versions consider using Pyenv to manage these, alternatively: brew install python@3 check the Python version: python --version ...and you should see something like: Now we will install GNU Make is a tool which will allow us to build and compile our package source code locally. brew install make Finally let's install Docker. We could do this straight from the website, but we are now command line ninjas and just need a couple of brewskies: brew install docker-compose followed by: brew install --cask docker Now we're ready to rock and roll forking our code from Github.","title":"Using the Command Line"},{"location":"playground/#forking-repositories","text":"We are going to use Github to \"fork\" or copy the latest version of the Bitcoin Core and the Plebnet Playground Docker repositories. Enter your Github and follow the links to both accounts. Bitcoin Plebnet Playground Click on the fork button to fork the original repositories into your own Github account. It will ask you to name the new fork, but you can keep the default name. Here is what my Github looks like below. You should see both forks under your remote Repositories tab.","title":"Forking repositories"},{"location":"playground/#git-cloning-repositories","text":"We are now going to use the git clone command to yes, clone the version you just forked onto your Github, onto to your local machine. Github conveniantly gives you an easy way to copy the comand straight to your terminal. Enter your forked Github repostiory and find the green Code button. On the drop down you will see options to clone. Unless you already have SSH setup with your Github (Github class) Copy the one under HTTPS. In your Terminal first lets create a new directory in Documents and call it Github. You can do this in the Finder, alternatively type: cd ~/Documents mkdir Github cd ~/Documents/Github Now type: git clone and then paste or CMD + V the address you just copied. It should look like this only addressed to your own Github: git clone https://github.com/addyourgithubhere/bitcoin.git Now lets do the same for the same for the Plebnet Playground repo. NOTE: Make sure you are actually inside the directory you want to clone into. git clone https://github.com/addyourgithubhere/plebnet-playground-docker.git Now you should see in your Finder window the two cloned repositories something like this: Pretty cool huh.","title":"Git cloning repositories"},{"location":"playground/#git-checkout","text":"Now for the the Bitcoin clone we want to check out that the version we have downloaded can be verified with the latest released commit. We do this by going into the Bitcoin/bitcoin original repo, scroll down to the bottom right Releases > Latest This brings up Bitcoin Core 23.0 as of time of writing, and on the subheading we can see a hash on the right which begins with fcf6c8 Click on this and we can see the commit hash on the right: fcf6c8f4eb217763545ede1766831a6b93f583bd Lets copy this and go back to Terminal and type: git checkout fcf6c8f4eb217763545ede1766831a6b93f583bd This will report back to us: You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch. This confirms we are indeed using the latest commit.","title":"Git Checkout"},{"location":"playground/#building-plebnet-docker","text":"Now we are going to build and compile the code base of the Plebnet Playground Docker.

This can be done via make build or make initialize .
